-- RETIRED 2026-10-07: this view was dropped from both cockroach and postgres. Nothing
-- consumes it: league reads nba.team_roster_vw, draft reads no roster view at
-- all, and a grep of every repo under ~/git finds no other reference.
-- This file is kept only as the surviving record of the definition -- DELETE IT if the view
-- proves not to be useful.
-- Caveat while it is here: scripts/apply_views.py globs sql/views/*/*.sql, so any run of it
-- re-creates the view this file was retired to remove. Move it out of that glob (or delete
-- it) before the next apply.
