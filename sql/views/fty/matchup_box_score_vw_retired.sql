-- Retired: superseded by matchup_box_score_vw, which keeps one row per category.
-- Pivots the long matchup_box_score back to one column per stat.
-- fgm/fga/ftm/fta are emitted whether or not the league scores them: calc_z_pcts() in
-- the R package needs them for every league, and the fg_pct/ft_pct ratios are derived
-- here rather than stored.
