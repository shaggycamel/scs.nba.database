create or replace view fty.matchup_box_score_vw as

-- Long form matchup results, one row per competitor per category.
-- Reads scored categories plus the shooting components (fgm/fga/ftm/fta) from
-- categories_vw, so the ratio z-scores keep their inputs whatever the league scores.
-- A ratio category (fg_pct) is built from its numerator/denominator, which live in
-- matchup_box_score even when the league does not score them; a points league gets
-- fantasy_points instead.
